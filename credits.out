2> about
p
  "You don’t really need to read these notes before playing, and they are sort of dry, but there are no spoilers here either."
p
  "You can see the whole game just by clicking blue links; no keyboard required. (You may need to scroll back occasionally.)"
p
  "On some touch screens, tapping to the right of the > will show the soft keyboard."
p
  "As of this writing, only Chrome supports speech recognition: click the gray microphone icon and speak a command."
p
  "Keyboard users may abbreviate enumerable commands to their first letter, except for CONTEMPLATE (X, L, or type a noun by itself) and ENUMERATE (Enter with no command). C means COMMUNICATE. E means EAST. (Weird, no?)"
p
  "The browser’s Back/Forward functions will undo/redo, and a bookmark will save a game in progress (including the full transcript), but the blue [undo] links along the right margin are usually all you need."
p
  "If you are playing while connected to the Internet, saved games can be restored on any Internet-connected browser or device by copying the URL."
p
  "You can play offline by loading the game while online and leaving the tab open as you travel, or by saving the page to disk; it’s one self-contained .html file. The game should save and restore properly even without network access, but only within the same browser."
p
  "Email me at "
  a href="mailto:zaphod@toastball.net"
    "zaphod@toastball.net"
  ". To include a game transcript, just email me the link. You can add notes to the transcript by entering a command that starts with * or #."
p
  "Huge thanks to everyone who made this game possible! See the CREDITS for a partial list."
