- shouldn't OPERATE LASER AT REFRIGERATOR do the same thing as SHOOT FRIDGE?
- @cioj: arrow keys for history
- auto-correct spelling

- follow up on problems AMBULATING to WORKBENCH (from KITCHEN): spell-correct?
- CONTEMPLATE WINDOW/DOOR/FRIDGE should describe bugs going in and out (if so)
- include a proper, hyperlinked walkthrough?
- @cioj: tab completion [without hurting accessibility, see 06-15 notes]
- such a flammable LAWN strains Andrew Schultz's credulity
- postpone SWEETIE's unprompted SMS, so I can use it to encourage @sbugs?
- when facing bug-riddled FUTON, bare AMBULATE should quail
- when toggling unbroken window, show bugs entering/leaving LR/DOOR if shooed?
- mention flyback xformer etc on mount/unmount? [why O LASER doesn't work @1st]
- ROTATE FUTON produces an unsatisfying response
- disambiguate laser target (e.g. FRIDE vs HIVE) -- that may help a lot
- give the PC infravision?  (to help explain laser breaking windowpane)
- clarify CIDER business somehow?
- follow up on "You are getting hungry!" somehow?
- I = CONTEMPLATE ME (and all that implies)?
- is "shoot laser at foo" acceptable syntax?  Does it need to be?
