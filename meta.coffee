exports.notes = """

  You don't really need to read these notes before playing, and
  they are sort of dry, but there are no spoilers here either.

  You can see the whole game just by clicking blue links; no keyboard
  required.  (You may need to scroll back occasionally.)

  On some touch screens, tapping to the right of the > will show
  the soft keyboard.

  As of this writing, only Chrome supports speech recognition: click
  the gray microphone icon and speak a command.

  Keyboard users may abbreviate enumerable commands to their first
  letter, except for CONTEMPLATE (X, L, or type a noun by itself)
  and ENUMERATE (Enter with no command).  C means COMMUNICATE.  E
  means EAST.  (Weird, no?)

  The browser's Back/Forward functions will undo/redo, and a bookmark
  will save a game in progress (including the full transcript), but
  the blue [undo] links along the right margin are usually all you
  need.

  If you are playing while connected to the Internet, saved games
  can be restored on any Internet-connected browser or device by
  copying the URL.

  You can play offline by loading the game while online and leaving
  the tab open as you travel, or by saving the page to disk; it's
  one self-contained .html file.  The game should save and restore
  properly even without network access, but only within the same
  browser.

  Email me at {zaphod@toastball.net}.  To include a game transcript,
  just email me the link.  You can add notes to the transcript by
  entering a command that starts with * or #.

  Huge thanks to everyone who made this game possible!  See the
  CREDITS for a partial list.
